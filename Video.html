      <div class = "video-description"><p>This is a film that I worked on for RTF343 Advanced Narrative. It's a story about an old couple and the difficulties they face. I chose this story because I knew it would be hard on the actors and I wanted to challenge myself as a director.</p></div>

      <div class = "video-description"><p>I made this film for RTF318 Intro to Narrative Production. It's a story about a couple and how they first met. I chose this story because it was simple and enjoyable.</p></div>

        <div class = "video"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-0SDFojzWwg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
        <div class = "video-description"><p>I made this film as my final project for the Liberal Arts Digital Storytelling Seminar. It's a story about a couple at three different points in their lives; when they were children, college age, and adult. It chose this story because it was difficult to tell and I knew I would need to take my production quality to the next level. The story was beautiful and painful and it needed non-linear storytelling and beautiful cinematography and music to match.</p></div>

      <h4>Economics Play</h4>
      <div class = "video-entry entry">
      <div class = "video"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8K5ps8Y4htw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
      <div class = "video-description"><p>This was my first short film made for high school macroeconomics class. It's a story about a government official whose arrogance helped cause the Great Depression and the redemption he seeks from it. I chose this story because it had to be somewhat related to economics. Also our production value and timeframe made it so we had to do a mostly dialogue based story with minimal locations.</p></div></div>
